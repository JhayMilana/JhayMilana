## About Me

Hello, my name is Jayvee Milana, I am a student software developer based in 
Winnipeg, MB.

I study software development at the Manitoba Institute of Trades and Technology. 
I am learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and C#. I have always been into tech 
since I first used my dadâ€™s laptop and I am passionate about making websites, 
apps, and games.

My hobbies are games, working out, and traveling. My interest in tech has always 
started with video games and furthermore when I built my own computer. In the 
past year, my friends have gotten me into the gym, which became one of my 
favorite things to do. Traveling has always been something my family loved to do 
and has grown with me since I was young.
